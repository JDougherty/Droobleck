Droobleck is a thick client for the Drupal open source CMS 
(http://drupal.org/). It is an admittedly niche utility to update 
content on a Druapl-based website. Droobleck is written in C++ using the 
Qt framework and supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL Drupal installs 
through the respective QSql plugins. 

Droobleck is heavily based upon the htmleditor from the Qt-Labs Graphics 
Dojo, available here:
